- `POSTGRES_HOST=localhost`
- `POSTGRES_PORT=5432`
- `POSTGRES_DB=hotel_california_backend`
- `POSTGRES_USERNAME=postgres`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=default`
-
- `USER_SUPERADMIN=superadmin`
- `USER_SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD=default`
-
- `USER_MANAGER=manager`
- `USER_MANAGER_PASSWORD=default`
-
- `USER_STAFF=staff`
- `USER_STAFF_PASSWORD=default`
-
- `USER_CHEF=chef`
- `USER_CHEF=default`
-

- `SECRET_KEY=ZT8kd3@LmZ4pXs96F!cVw%2GsR5+Ln#jDpYb9&vRk6WxJjT*HpZd`

#### .env - frontend

If the backend is hosted on a different address, update the VITE_API_URL environment variable:

- `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080`

### PostgreSQL Database

Create a PostgreSQL database with the name and credentials specified in the backend `.env` file (`POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_USERNAME, and POSTGRES_PASSWORD`). If a different database name is used, update it in the `.env` file as well.
